Initrd-helpers contains scripts and tools that can be used in init ramdisks.

General guidelines for initrd helper scripts:

* All debug / error / warning / info prints should be passed to /dev/kmsg
* This way problems can be seen from journal or dmesg if device booted up

The tools:

btrfs-mount-repair - Btrfs mounting script with automatic repair operations

Usage: ./btrfs-mount-repair <device> <mount-directory>
       device          - btrfs device to be repaired and mounted
       mount-directory - where to mount the device
NOTE:  If repair is succesful, device will be left mounted in
       mount-directory


find-mmc-bypartlabel - Tool for finding MMC device node by it's partition label

Usage: find-mmc-bypartlabel <label-name>
       label-name      - Labeled name of the partition
NOTE:  If mmc device with that partition label is found the device node path
       is printed

Examples:
       # find-mmc-bypartlabel sailfishos
       /dev/mmcblk0p14

       # export SFOS_DEV=$(find-mmc-bypartlabel sailfishos)
       # echo $SFOS_DEV
       /dev/mmcblk0p14
